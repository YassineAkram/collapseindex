## Purpose

Collapse Index Labs operates as both a research initiative and a commercial service provider. We publish research preprints and offer professional evaluation services for AI model robustness testing. The information, tools, and documents shared on this site are provided for research, educational, commercial evaluation, and informational purposes. These materials are intended for verification and audit purposes, not for replication or derivative deployment.

**Commercial Services:** Professional Evaluations and Collapse Index Synthetic Datasets (CISD) are offered under separate service agreements. Clients engaging these services are subject to additional terms including NDAs, SLAs, and pricing agreements.
